apiVersion: infrastructure.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: JiraCluster
metadata:
  name: my-cluster
spec:
  jiraProject: INFRA
  labels:
    cluster-name: my-cluster
    environment: production
```

## Developer Documentation Topics

### Architecture Documentation
- System overview and components
- CAPI contract implementation
- JIRA integration design
- Reconciliation flow diagrams
- Resource state machines
- Security architecture

### Contributing Guide
- Code of conduct
- Development environment setup
- Code style and conventions
- Testing requirements
- Pull request process
- Code review guidelines

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Setup development environment
git clone https://github.com/cblecker/cluster-api-provider-jira
cd cluster-api-provider-jira
make setup-envtest

# Make changes
# ... edit code ...

# Test and validate
make generate manifests fmt vet lint test

# Run locally
make run

# Run E2E tests
make test-e2e
```

## Deployment Configuration

### Kustomize Organization
- `config/crd/`: CustomResourceDefinition manifests
- `config/rbac/`: Role, RoleBinding, ServiceAccount
- `config/manager/`: Controller Deployment
- `config/webhook/`: Webhook configuration
- `config/default/`: Complete deployment kustomization
- `config/prometheus/`: Metrics and monitoring

### Multi-Platform Images
- Supported platforms: linux/arm64, linux/amd64, linux/s390x, linux/ppc64le
- Docker buildx for cross-platform builds
- Image tagging convention: `controller:latest`, `controller:v1.0.0`
- Registry: (to be configured)

### Certificate Management
- Webhook certificates (TLS)
- Metrics server certificates (TLS)
- cert-manager integration (recommended for production)
- Self-signed certs for development

## Release Process

### Version Management
- Follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Tag releases in git: `v1.0.0`
- Update version in manifests and documentation
- Maintain CHANGELOG.md

### Release Checklist
- [ ] Update version numbers
- [ ] Generate changelog
- [ ] Update compatibility matrix
- [ ] Build and test release artifacts
- [ ] Build multi-platform container images
- [ ] Tag git repository
- [ ] Create GitHub release
- [ ] Publish container images
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Announce release

### Release Artifacts
- `dist/install.yaml`: Complete installation manifest
- Container images: `ghcr.io/cblecker/cluster-api-provider-jira:vX.Y.Z`
- Source code archives (GitHub)
- Checksums and signatures

## Operational Documentation

### Observability
- **Metrics**: Controller metrics on `:8443` (HTTPS) or `:8080` (HTTP)

- **Monitoring**: Prometheus integration via ServiceMonitor

### Metrics Reference
- `controller_runtime_reconcile_total`: Total reconciliations
- `controller_runtime_reconcile_errors_total`: Reconciliation errors

- Well-organized and navigable

## Project Context

### Important Notes
- This is a **proof-of-concept** provider ("Seriously don't use this")
- Documentation should still be comprehensive for template/reference use
- Explain unique JIRA provider concepts (human-in-loop, async operations)
- Reference Cluster API documentation where appropriate
- Clarify limitations and non-production status

## Interaction Pattern

When invoked, you should:

1. **Understand Documentation Need**
   - What feature or component needs documentation?
   - Who is the target audience (users, developers, operators)?
   - What format is most appropriate?

2. **Research & Gather Information**
   - Review implementation details
   - Understand workflows and use cases
   - Identify common issues and solutions

3. **Create Documentation**
   - Write clear, comprehensive content
   - Include practical examples
   - Add diagrams or visuals if helpful
   - Follow documentation standards

4. **Validate Documentation**
   - Test examples and commands
   - Verify accuracy of information
   - Check links and references
   - Ensure completeness

5. **Maintain Documentation**
   - Update with implementation changes
   - Add new features and capabilities
   - Address user feedback
   - Keep release notes current

Remember: **Good documentation is as important as good code**. Clear, comprehensive documentation makes the provider accessible and usable.
